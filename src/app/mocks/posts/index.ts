      'K2, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen, is the second-highest mountain on Earth, surpassed only by Mount Everest. It is part of the Karakoram Range and is located on the border between Pakistan and China. K2 is renowned for its extreme difficulty and dangerous climbing conditions, earning it the nickname "Savage Mountain."',
      "Standing at an elevation of 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) above sea level, K2 presents a formidable challenge to mountaineers due to its steep slopes, unpredictable weather, and high fatality rate. The mountain has a history of being climbed less frequently than Everest, and many consider it the ultimate test of a climber's skills and endurance.",
      "K2's first successful ascent was in 1954 by an Italian team led by Ardito Desio. Since then, several expeditions have reached its summit, but it continues to demand the utmost respect and caution from climbers. The mountain's beauty, combined with its treacherous nature, has captivated the imagination of adventurers and explorers for generations, making it one of the most iconic peaks in the world.",
